## About The Project

This project is a personal endeavor to build a functional CV generator using React. It was developed as part of The Odin Project's curriculum, providing hands-on experience with component-based architecture, state management, and interactive UI development in React.

The goal was to create a user-friendly interface where users can input their personal, educational, and professional details, and instantly see a preview of their CV. This project helped solidify my understanding of React's core concepts and laid the groundwork for more complex applications.

### Built With

This project is built using the following technologies:

* [React](https://react.dev/)
* [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
* [CSS Modules](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-css-modules/) (or plain CSS, or your chosen styling solution)
* [HTML5]
* [JavaScript (ES6+)]
